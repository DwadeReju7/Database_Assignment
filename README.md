Created tables using CREATE TABLE statements for:

customers

categories

products

orders

order_items

Cleared old data by using DROP TABLE IF EXISTS at the top of my script to avoid errors when re-running.

Inserted sample data into each table using INSERT INTO statements to test relationships and foreign keys.

Checked data by running SELECT * FROM table_name; to view what was inside each table.

Fixed errors (like missing foreign key values) by:

Updating INSERT order (e.g., inserting categories before products)

Rewriting parts of the script in the Query Tool

Ran full scripts all in the same document to keep my schema and sample data organized.
