When considering that I had to create an e-commerce store it started off unnormalized with everyone in one table which 
included all of the order details. Using this method would be messy however, with repeated information. From their I moved into 
1NF, making sure that each column only had one value. After was 2NF -  I started breaking things up into separate tables. 
I realized things like customer info, product details, and order info shouldn’t all live in one place. So I split them up, 
and made sure each table had data that depended only on its main ID. Then I moved into 3NF, where I cleaned up anything that 
didn’t directly depend on the main key in the table. For example, instead of storing the product category name inside the 
products table over and over again, I made a separate category table and just used an ID to link them. By the end, my 
database was way more organized and made more sense — no repeated info, just clean relationships between tables.
